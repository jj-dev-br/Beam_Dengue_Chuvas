# Beam_Dengue_Chuvas

Simple project used to learn Apache Beam essentials.

# What it does
 
Data ingestion from a csv file and a txt file, one containing data about rains and the other containing data about the dengue flu through the days/months/years.
It transforms the data so it can be merged using the UF(states from Brazil) in which the rains and dengue have ocurred, then writing it to a csv file, allowing future data analysis.
After that, the other python file is a simple pandas transformation.
